# GCM-Android-Client-and-Rails-Server
GCM stack I made while learning creating GCM client and application server.

Last time I got my hands on GCM, it has changed for good. 
This repository contains sample client and application server. 
Client is made on Android and application server is made on Ruby on Rails.
